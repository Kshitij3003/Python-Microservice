The issue is likely because SonarQube is not detecting the coverage report generated by your tests. SonarQube requires a coverage report in a specific format (e.g., XML) to calculate code coverage. By default, `unittest` does not generate a coverage report. You need to use a tool like `coverage.py` to generate the report and configure SonarQube to read it.

Here’s how you can fix it:

1. **Install `coverage`**:
    Install the `coverage` package if you don’t already have it:
    ```bash
    pip install coverage
    ```

2. **Run tests with coverage**:
    Use `coverage` to run your tests and generate a coverage report:
    ```bash
    coverage run --source=app -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test*.py"
    ```

3. **Generate a coverage report**:
    Generate the coverage report in XML format:
    ```bash
    coverage report
    coverage xml
    ```

    This will create a file named `coverage.xml` in your project directory.

4. **Configure SonarQube**:
    Update your `sonar-project.properties` file to include the path to the coverage report:
    ```
    sonar.python.coverage.reportPaths=coverage.xml
    ```

5. **Run SonarQube analysis**:
    Run the SonarQube scanner to analyze your project:
    ```bash
    sonar-scanner
    ```

After completing these steps, SonarQube should correctly display the code coverage for your project.
