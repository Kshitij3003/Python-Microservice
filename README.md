# üöÄ End-to-End Automated CI/CD Pipeline for a Python Microservice

A production-grade, full-lifecycle DevOps project that demonstrates infrastructure provisioning, containerization, CI/CD, code quality analysis, and monitoring ‚Äî all automated and built using modern DevOps tools on AWS.
 
---

## üìå Objective

To automate the entire lifecycle of a Python microservice deployment ‚Äî from writing code to deploying on AWS with proper quality and security gates, monitoring, and alerts in place. This project simulates a real-world SaaS delivery platform.

## üß∞ Tech Stack

| Layer               | Tools Used                                           |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Source Control**   | GitHub + GitHub Copilot                             |
| **CI/CD**            | GitHub Actions + Shell Scripts                      |
| **Infrastructure**   | Terraform (VPC, EC2, IAM, ECR)                      |
| **Configuration**    | Ansible (Docker installation, app setup)            |
| **Application**      | Python REST API (Flask/FastAPI)                     |
| **Containerization** | Docker + AWS ECR                                    |
| **Deployment**       | EC2 (cost-effective, or ECS for scalable option)    |
| **Code Quality**     | SonarQube + FOSSA + Checkmarx                       |
| **Monitoring**       | AWS CloudWatch + APM + Custom Shell-based checks    |

## üîÑ Flow of Execution

1. **Code is pushed to GitHub**  
   GitHub Actions triggers both CI and CD workflows.

2. **CI Workflow:**
   - Lint & unit test Python app
   - Build Docker image and push to **ECR**
   - Run **SonarQube** for code quality
   - Run **FOSSA** for license check
   - Run **Checkmarx** for security scan

3. **CD Workflow:**
   - Provision AWS resources (VPC, EC2, ECR, Security Groups) using **Terraform**
   - Configure EC2 instance with **Ansible** (Docker, app deps)
   - Pull Docker image from ECR and run container on EC2
   - Setup AWS CloudWatch logs & APM integration

4. **Monitoring:**
   - App logs/metrics sent to **CloudWatch**
   - Uptime/health monitored with `health_check.sh`
   - Shell script sends alerts/Slack notification if service fails
